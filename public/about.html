<p>I am Cheniya Pibool, though you may call me Chenya. I graduated at the top of my class in Economics from Srinakarinwirot University. My professional journey began as a Compliance Officer at Bangkok Bank, and later I worked in Service Operations at Huawei Technologies (Thailand). I then took a break to travel to Australia for a language adventure. After eight months of experiencing Australian culture and improving my English, I returned to Thailand with a new career path in mind.</p>

<p>I decided to move into web development and am now focused on becoming a Full Stack Developer. Learning to code and design has been an exciting journey, and I am committed to gaining as much knowledge and skill as possible.</p>

<p>I am currently looking for opportunities to work as a Full Stack Developer. If you have any opportunities or know of any, I would love to connect. Let's see where this journey takes us.</p>
